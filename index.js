Regular expressions are used to define the tokens recognized by the scanner. Bison generates parser, which groups tokens into syntactical units and outputs a parse tree representation of the Imperator program. Context-free grammar is used to define the program structure recognized by a parser. For each syntactical unit recognized by Bison there is an action implemented in C++, which uses back of the compiler to generate assembler code.",
